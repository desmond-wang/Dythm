### This is the guide for you to download the music and theme that you want.

Please download **osu!mania** version. When you download it, it is a file with "osz" extension in the end,
please extract it (osz format is similar to rar or tar, just use regular zip tool to unzip it).
Once you extact it, it became a folder or folders that contain *.mp3* and *.osu* files in it.
Please move folder that contain *.mp3* and *.osu* file into
storage/emulated/0/Dythm/map

One example is a folder called "BLUE DRAGON", it contain "19. BLUE DRAGON.mp3" and
"BLUE DRAGON (AZVW_2) [AZVW's 4-Key Hard].osu"
Then you can move entire folder into "storage/emulated/0/Dythm/map"
